        Rules:<br />
        The object of the game is to be the first player to score 100 points (or
        another number if defined). This is done by the rolling of two dice.
        Players play by turns. To accumulate points, a pair of dice is rolled. A
        player gets the total of the dice, unless a "one" comes up, which is
        called a skunk (like the animal), in which case he gets no point and
        it's the other player's turn. If two skunks come up, he loses all his
        points since the beginning of the game and it's the other player's turn.
        And if a player gets a "double", he gets the total of the dice but the
        other player gets minus the total. If a "one" doesn't occur, the player
        may choose either to try for more points by rolling the dice again, or
        to stop and keep what he or she has accumulated.
